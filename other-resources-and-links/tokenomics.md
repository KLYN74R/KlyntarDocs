# Tokenomics

## Intro

Tokenomics is an important document for any crypto project as it helps to understand the potential of the coin from a financial point of view, helps to estimate the percentage of increase in emission and predict the price.

Below we present you a detailed description of our tokenomics. **Research and remember** - <mark style="color:red;">**D Y O R**</mark> (<mark style="color:red;">**D**</mark>o <mark style="color:red;">**Y**</mark>our <mark style="color:red;">**O**</mark>wn <mark style="color:red;">**R**</mark>esearch).

It is also worth clarifying - below are only general charts (in the form of pictures), so we strongly recommend studying tokenomics by simply visiting the Google spreadsheet:

## General&#x20;

We start with the most general chart that will show how much percentage each side of the project receives

## Allocation accumulation over the time

The second chart shows what total percentage each side has over the time

## Allocation per month

The last diagram shows the percentage of coins that will be created in the system each month, as well as the shares that will be distributed between the parties - the team, investors and of course - the community

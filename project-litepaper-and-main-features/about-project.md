Being true fans and geeks who are inspired by cryptocurrency and the technologies/principles that underlie it, we also want to offer the world our project.

> **The idea was to create not another clone/fork, but a truly useful and long-lasting product. To do this, we have collected the best practices in the crypto industry, collected the most powerful and popular technologies and cryptography and are going to create a powerful foundation for the future decentralized ecosystem of services**

## What you can find here ?

### Decentralized L1 chain as a foundation for experiments

Klyntar is a decentralized L1 network. The same as Ethereum, Solana, TON and many others! You will be familiar with working with our project.

### Maximum decentralization: Multistaking - a nextgen liquid restaking

With the goal of

### Interesting architecture: Multilevel sharding

### Advanced cryptography

### 2 most used virtual machines on the board - EVM and WASM

### Codeless smart-contracts - road to smart-contracts usage in real-world business

### Ecosystem of services

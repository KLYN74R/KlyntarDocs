# Claiming rewards

## Intro

When you stake your coins on a validator, you help it get the opportunity to generate blocks and vote for other creators' blocks.

In return, the validator will share part of its profits with you.

When the validator is working, rewards are accrued to the validator's storage.

However, only you have the right to take your rewards - so your funds are safe. Neither the validator itself, nor any of the stakers will be able to take what was earned by your stake.
{% endhint %}

## Automatic reward accrual

On Klyntar, rewards are credited automatically <mark style="color:red;">**AT THE END OF AN EPOCH**</mark> directly to your account. So you don't have to do anything :relaxed: - you get rewards without any conditions.

## How to check how much you received

On the page with info about validator you can find the list of stakers below

Now if you paste your address into the searchbar, you will see your address and the total number of coins you received during the staking

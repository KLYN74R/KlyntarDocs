# Run your private testnet with 21 nodes

## Intro

Running 21 validators manually is very difficult. To make this possible, we recommend using our NetRunner tool.

To do this, follow the instructions on the page:

{% content-ref url="netrunner.md" %}
[netrunner.md](netrunner.md)
{% endcontent-ref %}

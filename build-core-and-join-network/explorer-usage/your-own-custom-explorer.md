# Your own custom explorer

## Intro

During development, it is often useful to visualize changes in the chain.

For example, when launching a private testnet, it would be interesting to know the details of the network operation - created blocks, transaction statuses, validators, shards, and so on.

That is why we decided to make our explorer open source. But in general, there are two reasons:

1. The ability to make changes to the common repository by different developers
2. The ability to simplify the process of development and interaction with the Klyntar network

Therefore, below you will see the process of launching a local explorer and a short guide on using it using the example of a local testnet with 1 shard and 1 validator
